A portfolio of projects for sharing applied techniques in data science.

# Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to view this portfolio. I'm Thomas Bahng, the author and an analyst with a decade of experience in Business Intelligence. My formal education includes a Masters in Applied Data Science. My drive is to help businesses make better decisions through customer-centric and data-driven products.

In this portfolio you will find a demonstration of applied methods by the author across a variety of data and use-cases. Each project will contain one or more presentation documents and a README that outlines further steps and information.
